## Nested classes and enums

Need to switch to a two pass approach.  Separate the building and the rendering of nodes.

## Overloaded functions and methods

The current approach uses a flat dictionary with fully qualified names as the key.

# Make property

# Make method

Idea is to take a C function and make it a method of a class

```yaml
specs:
    ''
```
